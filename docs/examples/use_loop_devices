For testing purposes we can use loop devices to mimic real hard drives. Here is a quick how to :

Assuming we need 3 storage devices for our 3 nodes gluster-kubernetes deployment 

First create a blank raw disk image (50GB in our case):
    # dd if=/dev/zero of=disk0.img bs=1024k seek=50000 count=0
    0+0 records in
    0+0 records out
    0 bytes (0 B) copied, 2.7301e-05 s, 0.0 kB/s
    # ls -lh
    total 50G
    -rw-r--r-- 1 root root  50G Dec 13 11:13 disk0.img
Mount it as a loopback device :
    # losetup -f disk0.img
    # losetup -a

Check that it seems to be a valid block device:
    # fdisk /dev/loop0
    
    
    Repeat the above steps in each node . Once finished the topology.json should be edited to reflect your /dev/loop0 devices
